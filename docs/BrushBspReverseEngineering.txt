This is a document detailing any findings regarding Brushes and BSP info
in Unreal Engine 1. As far as I know, there is no info online that describes
any of these formats in detail. 

UShock is a level viewer that has had RE work done on the level format, 
but the methods of RE are questionable and the code is not very clean.

Brush

All brushes seem to contain property lists that describe their information
in well enough detail. This could be used for exporting to T3D and the like.

Might store the Surface properties?? Needs more investigation
