Some notes;
  If the property size says it is 5 (a byte follows with the real size), the size byte is AFTER the name index

StructProperty loading from defaultproperties:
  Var name (name index)
  Info byte (0x#A)
  Struct name (name index)
  Struct size (byte)
    - NOTE!!!: This is **NOT** the expected size of the struct, but the 
      number of bytes that should be parsed
  Array Index (if struct is part of array)
  Member variables:
    Byte = read 1 byte
    Int = read 1 int
    float = read 1 float
    Name = read index?
    Class = read object reference
    Object = read obejct reference
    String = read string (read index for size, read <size> number of characters (bytes))
    Array  = ?????
